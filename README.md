```lrc
[00:13.60] City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
[00:18.13] Dressed in holiday style in the air
[00:23.16] There's a feeling of Christmas
[00:28.66] Children laughing, people passing
[00:31.79] Meeting smile after smile
[00:35.23] And on every street corner you'll hear
[00:54.23] 
[00:41.78] Silver bells (silver bells)
[00:45.69] Silver bells (silver bells)
[00:48.96] It's Christmas time in the city
[00:56.13] Ring a ling (ring a ling), hear them sing (hear them sing)
[01:03.33] Soon it will be Christmas day...
[01:19.33] 
[01:11.95] Strings of street lights
[01:15.47] Even stop lights blink a bright red and green
[01:19.95] As the shoppers rush home
[01:22.19] With their treasures
[01:32.19] 
[01:26.58] Hear the snow crunch
[01:28.93] See the kids bunch
[01:30.56] This is Santa's big scene
[01:34.00] And above all this bustle you'll hear
[01:52.50] 
[01:40.37] Silver bells (silver bells)
[01:44.58] Silver bells (silver bells)
[01:48.11] It's Christmas time in the country
[01:54.57] Ring a ling (ring a ling), hear them sing (hear them sing)
[02:02.70] Soon it will be Christmas day...
[02:18.70] 
[02:39.65] Silver bells (silver bells)
[02:43.24] Silver bells (silver bells)
[02:46.66] It's Christmas time in Hawaii
[02:53.28] Ring a ling (ring a ling)
[02:57.07] Hear them sing (hear them sing)
[03:00.74] Soon it will be Christmas day
[03:07.17] Soon it will be Christmas day

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling, hear them ring, ting-a-ling
Soon it will be Christmas day

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear

Silver bells, silver bells, silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling, hear them ring, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

Strings of streetlights even stop lights blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids rush, this is Santa's big day
And above all this bustle you'll hear

Silver bells, the corner Santa Claus, silver bells, is busy now because
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, it fills the winter air, hear them ring, you'll hear it everywhere
Soon it will be Christmas day

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks dressed in holiday style
(Silver bells, silver bells)
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
(It's Christmas time in the city)
Children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile
(Ring-a-ling, hear them ring)
Very soon it will be Christmas day
(Soon it will be Christmas day)

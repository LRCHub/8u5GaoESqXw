(Chorus)
(Silver bells), silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
(Ring-a-ling), Ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling, ring
Hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

(Verse 1)
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's, (In the air there's)
A feeling
Of Christmas
(A feling of christmas)
Children laughing
People passing
Meeting smile, meeting smile, after smile
And on ev'ry street corner you'll hear

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
Strings of street lights
Even stop lights
Blinking bright, blinking bright red and green yeah yeah
As the shoppers
Rush home, with treasures
(Christmas times as time for giving)
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all, this bustle
You will hear, oh, oh, ooh

(Chorus)

(Silver Bells)
Repeat Until Fade...

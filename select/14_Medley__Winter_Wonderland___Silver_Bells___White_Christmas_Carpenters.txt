Sleigh bells ring
Are you listening
In the lane
Snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the blue bird
Here to stay is a new bird
He songs a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married?
We'll say no man
But you can do the job
While you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Silver Bells
Silver Bells
Hear them ring
Silver Bells
City sidewalks
Busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing
People passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear
Silver Bells (Silver Bells)
Silver Bells (Silver Bells)
Silver Bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ting-a-ling (Ting-a-ling)
Ting-a-ling
Hear them ring
Hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas Day
The sun is shining, the grass is green
The orange and palm trees sway
There's never been such a day in Beverly Hills L.A.
But it's December the 24th and I'm longing to be up north
I'm dreaming of a White Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and Children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a White Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
